# Poker Action Predictor
This repository contains my primary contribution to the final project [Reinforcement Isn't All You Need: Fully Supervised Learning Tasks in Poker](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10j4FiFZ99gimOy4PElNDgGLGCbmgNnwy/view?usp=sharing) for the course CSE 151B, Deep Learning, taken in the Winter 2024 quarter at UC San Diego with Professor Gary Cottrell. 

Here, we use a GRU-RNN to predict a player's next action in a game of Texas Hold 'em Poker based on the previous sequence of actions. Out of a set of 10 possible actions, we reach around ~70% test accuracy.
